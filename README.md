-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
the variables that mosly unlikely to provide non random amount of variance to the mpg values in this dataset are the (Intercept), Vehicle_length & thhe ground_clearnce

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

the r-squared value is equal to 0.7, which means that roughly 70% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg of MechaCar prototypes ) is explained using the linear regression model and this means that the model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

-The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils meets the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch for all manufacturing lots in total and for lot 1 & 2 however this requirement is not applicable in lot 3 as the variance indicates 170.2 and therefor it does not meet the required specification
