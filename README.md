## Linear Regression to Predict MPG##

-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
the variables that mosly unlikely to provide non random amount of variance to the mpg values in this dataset are the (Intercept), Vehicle_length & thhe ground_clearnce

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

the r-squared value is equal to 0.7, which means that roughly 70% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg of MechaCar prototypes ) is explained using the linear regression model and this means that the model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
